# DirtyNIB

In `dirtynib/Window.xib` you have the malicious `.xib` file mentioned in the original DirtyNIB research: https://blog.xpnsec.com/dirtynib/

To create your own malicion `.nib` file, just modify this `.xib` file at the end of it to make it execute whatever you need, compile the project, and get the Window.nib file from the compiled version.
